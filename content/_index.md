title: Hugo on Azure demo site
---

Hi there! This is a starter [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) blog demonstrating deployment from [GitHub](http://github.com) to [Azure Web Apps](http://azure.microsoft.com). Pretty nifty, right?

This demo was created by Rachel Weil. It's a stripped down version of the website she created for [FEMICOM Museum](http://www.femicom.org), which is also built in Hugo.

To get the most out of your new Hugo blog, check out the [Hugo docs](http://docs.gohugo.io).

You can check out Rachel's website, [No Bad Memories](http://www.nobadmemories.com) or find her on [GitHub](http://github.com/hxlnt) or [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/partytimehxlnt).
